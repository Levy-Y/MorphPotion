# MorphPotion
Morph potion, that turns you into a random mob. Inspired by Knarfy!

# Dependencies
- Latest [morph](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/morph.8846/) plugin (not mod)
- Latest dev [protocollib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/releases/tag/5.1.0) build
- Latest [libs disguises](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/) version
- Latest [nbtapi](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nbt-api.7939/) version

# Installation
Just drag and drop the plugin into your plugins folder, along with the other plugins, and then restart your server.

# Usage
For now it only adds in the "Morph Potion" potion, which is uncraftable (only obtainable by admins)
So I would recommend something like [Oraxen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oraxen-custom-items-blocks-emotes-furniture-resourcepack-and-gui-1-18-1-20-4.72448/) (paid),
or [CustomCrafting](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/customcrafting-advanced-custom-recipe-plugin-1-16-1-19-free.55883/) (free), to add a custom crafting recipe for the potion!
